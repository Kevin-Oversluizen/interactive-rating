## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

Mostly needed to refresh creating content from scratch instead of making adjustment/updating content.
So this was a good excercise in basic markup, Styling and responsiveness.

Definitely am rusty and need more practice in this field but it came back bit by bit.

Concerning Javscript I am in the progress of learning the language and having some difficulty figuring out what to use where and when. Used some sources like chatGPT for advice without really getting solutions from there.
I think it was a good exercise to get exposed and practice. Will definitely do some more research/recap on manipulating the DOM.

### Continued development

Revisit videos and sections on DOM manipulation since this is the most relevant skill I needed for this project and I am not comfortable enough yet.
